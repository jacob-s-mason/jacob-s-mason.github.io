# Work created by Jacob Mason to be used for great things
This is an open portfolio. Any and all code in either this site or my repository can be used, copied, and enhanced by anyone who wishes to do great things.

This will mainly consist of R code since I am a statistician at heart.

## Applications and Explorations of Benford's Law

-[What is Benfords Law?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law)
  -Benfords law is nothing short of fascinating. 
  -The leading digits of naturaly occuring numbers (any naturally occuring number set) that spans mutiple factors of 10 (1,10,100,1000, etc.) will follow a distrobution with roughly 30% leading digit 1s to about 5% leading digit 9s.
  -This applies to lenght of rivers, zip codes, the size of computer files,.... and prices :)
  -It can also be used in court as evidence of improper book keeping (otherwise known as cooking the books)
  -One of my goals is to explore the application and uses of Benfords law in openly available sets of data.

### Evidence and Applications of Benford's Law in Small Cap Markets
- [Empirical Evidence of Benford's Law in Small Cap Markets (Paper)](docs/assests/Empirical Evidence of Benford Law in Small Cap Markets.pdf)
- [PowerPoint Presentation of the above](docs/assests/Benford Presentation.pptx)
- This is a technical paper that was written during my graduate studies at Clemson University.
- It explores if the distributions of leading digits in Benford's law apply to US Small Cap Markets (i.e. the Russell 2000).
- I was trying (to no avail) to determine if, knowing that Benford's law exists in these markets, a favorable trading strategy could be developed.
- Trading frequency and transactions costs were the downfall of this idea.
- However; I plan to revisit this in the near future and expand on my past work.
