# Work created by Jacob Mason to be used for great things
This is an open portfolio.  Any and all code in either this site or my respository can be used, copied, and enhanced by anyone who wishes to do great things. 

This will mainly consist of R code since I am a statistician at heart.

## Applications and Explorations of Benfords Law 

-Details

### Evidence and Applications of Benfords Law in Small Cap Markets     
  - [Empircal Evidence of Benfords Law in Small Cap Markets](docs/assests/Empirical Evidence of Benford Law in Small Cap Markets.pdf) 
  - This was a technical paper that was written during my graduate studies at Clemson Unversity.
  - It explores if the distrobutions of leading digits in Benfords law apply to US Small Cap Markets (i.e. the Russell 2000).
  - I was trying (to no avail) to determine if, knowing that Benfords law exists in these markets, a favorable trading strategy could be developed.
  - Trading frequency and transactions costs were my downfall.
  - However; I plan to revisit this idea in the near future and expand on my past work.
