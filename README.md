# Work created by Jacob Mason to be used for great things
This is an open portfolio. Any and all code in either this site or any of my repositories can be used, copied, and enhanced by anyone who wishes to do great things.

This will mainly consist of R code since I am a statistician at heart.

## Applications and Explorations of Benford's Law

[What is Benford's Law?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law)
  
   -Benfords law is nothing short of fascinating.
   
   -The leading digits of naturally occurring numbers (any naturally occuring number set) that spans multiple factors of 10 (1,10,100,1000, etc.) will follow a distribution with roughly 30% leading digit 1s decreasing in sequence down to 5% leading digit 9s
   
   -This applies to the length of rivers, zip codes, the size of computer files,.... and prices :)
   
   -It can also be used in court as evidence of improper accounting practices (otherwise known as cooking the books)
   
   -One of my goals is to explore the application and uses of Benford's law in openly available sets of data.

### Evidence and Applications of Benford's Law in Small Cap Markets
- [Empirical Evidence of Benford's Law in Small Cap Markets (Paper)](docs/assests/Empirical Evidence of Benford Law in Small Cap Markets.pdf)
- This is a technical paper that was written during my graduate studies at Clemson University.
- It explores if the distributions of leading digits in Benford's law apply to US Small Cap Markets (i.e. the Russell 2000).
- I was trying (to no avail) to determine if, knowing that Benford's law exists in these markets, a favorable trading strategy could be developed.
- Trading frequency and transactions costs were the downfall of this idea.
- However; I plan to revisit this in the near future and expand on my past work.

### Revisiting Russell 2000 Index and Benfords Law
- [Github Repository for this project (Currently Collecting Data)](https://github.com/jacob-s-mason/Benfords-Law-and-Russell-2000)
- Pulling daily data for all securties in the Russell 2000
- Starting on 2/24/2025
- After pulling data for 30-45 Days, then I will begin to examine the transitional probabilities of the securities based on different time periods.


## Econometrics and Model Building
- Most of my graduate work was conducted with observational economic data.
- Models are valuable when they are clear and explainable. 
- Most AI/Machine Learning models are enigmatic black boxes.
- My next endeavor will be into model building and econometrics.... once I find an interesting idea to pursue.
