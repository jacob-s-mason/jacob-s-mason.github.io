## Applications and Explorations of Benford's Law

-Details

### Evidence and Applications of Benford's Law in Small Cap Markets
- [Empirical Evidence of Benford's Law in Small Cap Markets](docs/assests/Empirical Evidence of Benford Law in Small Cap Markets.pdf)
- This was a technical paper that was written during my graduate studies at Clemson University.
- It explores if the distributions of leading digits in Benford's law apply to US Small Cap Markets (i.e. the Russell 2000).
- I was trying (to no avail) to determine if, knowing that Benford's law exists in these markets, a favorable trading strategy could be developed.
- Trading frequency and transactions costs were my downfall.
- However; I plan to revisit this idea in the near future and expand on my past work.
